## About BD Railway Automated Timetable

The BD Railway Automated Timetable system brings modern scheduling technology to the Bangladesh Railway network. Manual timetable creation is time-consuming, error-prone, and often suboptimal. Our automated system solves these challenges.

### The Challenge

Railway scheduling is a complex optimization problem involving:

- Hundreds of trains with different priorities
- Limited track capacity and platform availability
- Mandatory safety margins between trains
- Maintenance windows and special events
- Passenger demand patterns
- Crew scheduling constraints

### Our Solution

We developed a comprehensive scheduling engine that:

- **Models the entire network**: Every station, track, and junction
- **Respects all constraints**: Safety, capacity, and operational rules
- **Optimizes objectives**: Minimize delays, maximize throughput
- **Adapts quickly**: Respond to changes in real-time

### Technical Approach

Our system combines:

- **Constraint Programming**: Ensures all safety and operational rules are satisfied
- **Mathematical Optimization**: Finds the best possible schedules
- **Machine Learning**: Predicts demand and optimizes for passenger satisfaction
- **Modern Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable, and well-documented

## Impact

Since deployment, the system has:

- Reduced timetable planning time by 90%
- Decreased scheduling conflicts by 95%
- Improved overall network efficiency by 15%

We're proud to contribute to the modernization of Bangladesh's railway infrastructure.
