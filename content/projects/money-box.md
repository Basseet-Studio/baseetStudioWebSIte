## About Money Box

Money Box was born from a simple idea: managing your money shouldn't be complicated. We've created an intuitive app that makes saving money feel effortless and even enjoyable.

### Our Mission

We believe everyone deserves financial peace of mind. Money Box is designed to help you build healthy money habits, one small step at a time.

### Why We Built This

As developers who struggled with traditional budgeting apps, we wanted something different. Something that focuses on the positive—watching your savings grow—rather than just tracking expenses.

## Coming Soon

Money Box is currently in development. Join our early access list to be notified when we launch and get exclusive beta access.
