## About Numu

Numu (meaning "growth" in our vision) is more than a habit tracker—it's your companion on the journey to self-improvement. We've designed every detail to make building habits feel natural and rewarding.

### Our Philosophy

Small actions, repeated consistently, lead to extraordinary results. Numu is built on this principle, helping you focus on daily progress rather than perfection.

### The Science Behind Numu

We've incorporated insights from behavioral psychology and habit formation research. Features like streak tracking leverage the power of consistency, while our reminder system uses spaced repetition to build lasting habits.

## Coming Soon

Numu is currently in development. Join our early access list to be notified when we launch and get exclusive beta access.
